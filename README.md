#### AACI Journal Article
* [http://www.aacijournal.com/content/10/1/38](http://www.aacijournal.com/content/10/1/38)
		
> Location of fatal reaction: Of the 40 fatalities caused by food allergies, 14 cases occurred at home. The remainder 24 cases occurred outside the home including at restaurants or a wedding (n = 15), at school (n = 4), camp (n = 3), and at another person’s home (n = 2). Location of reaction was not reported in 2 cases. Among the 34 cases with a previous food related reaction, 3 people knowingly ingested the allergen (one case was a suicide), and in 7 cases, people failed to read labels restaurant menus or ask about ingredients. An almost equal number of drug reactions occurred at home (n = 8) and the hospital (n = 7). One death occurred at a long term care facility. Fatal drug reactions that occurred at home (n = 8) were most commonly caused by antibiotics (63%). One patient had a previous reaction to the responsible antibiotic. The most common culprit in hospital reactions (n = 7) was radiocontrast dye (4 cases), for which there was no prior allergy reported in all 4 cases. In 22 cases, the Coroner’s report did not include enough information to determine the location of the fatal reaction.

#### Article: US National Library of Medicine National Institute of Health - Precautionary labelling of foods for allergen content: are we ready for a global framework?
* [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24791183](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24791183)
		
> There is no globally agreed-upon method to detect and label allergens. Even within individual countries, it may be difficult to enact legislation regarding PAL because reliable allergen detection techniques are still being developed and reactivity thresholds need more research. What would be encouraged is uniformity amongst manufacturers in assessing the risk and in communicating that risk in a clear way. This would help ensure the safety of food-allergic consumers around the world.
